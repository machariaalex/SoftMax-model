Softmax Classifier
A Softmax Classifier is a machine learning algorithm that is used for multi-class classification problems. It is an extension of the logistic regression algorithm, which can only handle binary classification problems.

How it works
The Softmax Classifier calculates the probability of each class, given an input feature vector. The class with the highest probability is then selected as the output label. The Softmax Classifier uses the Softmax activation function to calculate the class probabilities.
